# Tic-tac-toe AI

Tic-tac-toe AI using Minimax algorithm with AB pruning. My Heuristic evaluation logic is largely inspired by this [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43622/Solve-Tic-Tac-Toe-with-the-MiniMax-algorithm).

## Implementation

By reducing search tree depth, along with added noise as a result of applying bounded random values to the terminal nodes, I was able to implement different levels of difficulty. Moreover, randomness adds to the feeling of playing against a human instead of a computer.

UI inspired by [2048 game](https://play2048.co/).
