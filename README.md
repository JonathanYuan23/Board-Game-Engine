# Tic-tac-toe
Took ui inspiration from [2048 game](https://play2048.co/)
- Learned how to use the 'pubsub' module pattern
- Pretty proud of myself for figuring out the diagonal and vertical strikethrough animations (set transform origin to any corner)
## Todo
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] implement ai using minimax algorithm
- [ ] mobile responsive
